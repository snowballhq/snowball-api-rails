      %strong Creating an Snowball Account and Profile Information:
  %p
    %span
      %span When you create an Snowball account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, for example your profile picture. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.

    %span
      %strong Contact Information:
  %p
    %span
      %span In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you with other Snowball users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.

      %strong Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services:
  %p
    %span
      %span Our Services include several features to help you find the accounts of people you already know. For example, you may upload information from your address book. 
    %span
      %span Snowball will match the information you provide with the contact information of other Snowball users.

      %strong Content, Following, and other Public Information:
  %p
    %span
      %span Snowball is a video sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on
      %span ,
      %span and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a range of users and other services that access Snowball. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
  %p  
  %p
    %span
      %strong Private Content:
  %p
    %span
      %span Snowball may make available to you the ability to make an account or specific pieces of Content “private,” in which case the content you create in a “private” setting will not be publicly shared without your direct action. “Private” Content is still stored on our servers and is accessible via URL to anyone who has the link to the Content. 
    %span
      %span Users should be aware that any Content they share, even with in the “private” setting, can be distributed and shared by any users with access to the Content or URL link to the Content. Snowball makes no warranties or claims as to the security and privacy of “private” Content and users should think carefully about content they share, given that “private” content, much like email, can easily become public through the user’s or others’ actions.
  %p
    %span
      %strong Links:
  %p
    %span
      %span We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services,
      %span for example to provide relevant advertising,
      %span and to be able to compile aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
  %p
    %span
      %strong Cookies:
  %p
    %span
      %span Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Snowball may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from Snowball or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
  %p
    %span
      %strong Log Data:
  %p
    %span
      %span Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, view videos hosted by Snowball, or interact with our email notifications. Snowball uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
  %p
    %span
      %strong Third-Party Service Providers:
  %p
    %span
      %span Snowball uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting services, online storage services and analytics services to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics or Mixpanel. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
